          <p className="mb-3">
            The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on
            the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may
            use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer
            or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a "device") by the web server so that a website
            can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is
            frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than
            the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar
            technologies (collectively, "Tags") may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with
            advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has
            functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser's
            cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting
            new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how
            to clear your browser's cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you
            can consult the information at{' '}

          <p className="mb-3">
            Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features.
            Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit
            our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the
            Website.

          <p className="mb-3">The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:</p>

            Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this
            data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver
            targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users
            from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected
            from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online
            experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie
            information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements
            and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor's referral source
            to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience
            segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.
